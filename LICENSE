If you want to use the MIT License for your project, you should use the official text exactly as written. You only need to fill in:
- The copyright year
- The copyright holder name(s)

The standard license text exists in public repositories because it's meant to be used verbatim - that's how open source licenses work.

If you need a different license with different terms, consider other standard licenses like Apache 2.0, BSD, or GPL instead.
